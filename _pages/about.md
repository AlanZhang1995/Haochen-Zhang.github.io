I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of California San Diego. My mentor is Prof. [Truong Q. Nguyen](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=48) at the [Video Processing Lab](http://videoprocessing.ucsd.edu/?page_id=22). Before joining UCSD, I received my Bachelor and Master degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, with the supervision of Prof.  [Dong Liu](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/dongeliu/en/index/85593/list/index.htm). My current research is related to retinal image analysis.
