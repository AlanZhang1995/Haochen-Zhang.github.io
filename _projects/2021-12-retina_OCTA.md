Detect and differentiate active and inactive choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in different stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) scans. It is like a fine-grained classification problem since the categories belong to one disease but in different stages. The challenges are small dataset with unbalanced distribution and potential retina layer segmentation errors.
