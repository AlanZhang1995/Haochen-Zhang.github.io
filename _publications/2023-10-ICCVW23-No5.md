In this paper, we experimentally verified that the OCTA projections, which ophthalmologists usually use for diagnosis, are easily affected by layer segmentation errors. Those errors degrade the classification performance.

We propose to use 3D raw OCTA volume to avoid the impacts of those errors. To achieve this, we modify a pretrained 2D network to perform volume classification. We also adopt an additional projection supervision to facilitate training of shallow feature extractor.

The layers in blue have pretrained weights while those in red are trained from scratch." %}

Experimental results show that the proposed classifier can achieve the accuracy of more than 80%, regardless of the presence of layer segmentation errors. These results prove the effectiveness of our methods and suggest that OCTA is a promising modality to distinguish various stages of AMD disease.
