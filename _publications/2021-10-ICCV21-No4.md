Formulated unpaired SR training as a feature-level domain adaptation problem, where the given LR images can be regard as the inputs in target domain and the provided HR images can be seen as label in source domain. Adopted adversarial-based feature distribution alignment to close the gap between source and target feature domains, and proposed several feature domain regularizations to achieve better aligning performance as well as preserve image details for the downstream SR task.
